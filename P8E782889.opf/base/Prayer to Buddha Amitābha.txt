Prayer to Buddha Amitābha
by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje

gyal kun chi zuk chö ku ö ta yé
O dharmakāya Amitābha, embodiment of all the buddhas,
tukjé rang tsal gönpo chenrezik
And protector Avalokiteśvara, manifestation of compassion,
kyabné tartuk chok la solwa dep
To these ultimate and supreme sources of refuge, I pray!
dak dang kha nyam ma gen semchen nam
May I and all beings, my previous mothers, as infinite as space,
tsé dir midö kyen shyi lek tsok gyé
Face no unfavourable conditions, only ever-increasing positivity.
dikdral yönten gyé dang gé chu jor
May we be free from misdeeds and have the eight qualities and ten virtues;
chimar dechen dakpé shying du drö
And, in our future lives, may we travel to the pure realm of Great Bliss!
lü ten dé la chang chub chok tob né
Bless us, so that having attained buddhahood in that physical form,
ta lé drowa dren la gön khyé dang
We may become a guide who leads beings from extremes,
nyampé tu wang tobpar chin gyi lop
And gain strength and power just like yours.
Supplicate like this with a one-pointed mind, and recite:
om ami dhewa hrih
oṃ amitābha hrīḥ

Thus, in response to a request from Demchok Lhamo of noble family, the one known as Karmapa
put this into writing.
